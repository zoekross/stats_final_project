Describing Data and Research Question:

Our data is an analysis of Bob Ross's paintings that show when certain elements of nature such as trees or rocks appear in his work. This data set comes from the fivethirtyeight package in R studio and it was collected by counting the number of certain objects in 403 of his paintings. We hope to learn more about how specific elements in his paintings influence the likelihood that a tree will appear in that same piece of artwork.

Question: We will work to examine how the frequencies of specific variables (clouds, rocks, and flowers) in his paintings affect the likelihood of trees appearing in his works.

```{r echo=FALSE}
bob_ross <- bob_ross
```


### Graphs

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bob_ross) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = tree), fill = "lightblue", color= "white")
```

The vast majority of Bob Ross's paintings have trees in them.


```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bob_ross) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = flowers), fill = "lightblue", color= "white")
```

The vast majority of Bob Ross's paintings do NOT have flowers in them.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=bob_ross) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=flowers, fill=factor(tree)), position = "fill")
```

Only about 20% of the paintings that have flowers have have trees.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bob_ross) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = clouds), fill = "lightblue", color= "white")
```

Approximately half of his paintings have clouds in them and half of them do not.


```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=bob_ross) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=clouds, fill=factor(tree)), position = "fill")
```

About 75% of the paintings that have clouds have trees.


```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bob_ross) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = rocks), fill = "lightblue", color= "white")
```

Most of his paintings do not have rocks in them, but there are about 75 that do.


```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=bob_ross) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=rocks, fill=factor(tree)), position = "fill")
```

About 75% of the paintings that have rocks do not have trees.


### Models


```{r echo=FALSE}
glm_flower <- glm(tree ~ flowers ,
                  data= bob_ross, family=binomial)
tidy(glm_flower)%>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  mutate(exp_est = exp(estimate))
```

On average, the presence of flowers in a painting increases the odds of having a tree in the painting .596. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
tidy(glm_flower)%>%
  mutate(lowerCI = estimate - 2*std.error,
         upperCI = estimate + 2*std.error)%>%
  select(term,upperCI,lowerCI,p.value)
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
glm_cloud <- glm(tree ~ clouds,
                  data= bob_ross, family=binomial)
tidy(glm_cloud)%>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  mutate(exp_est = exp(estimate))
```

On average, the presence of clouds in a painting increases the odds of having a tree in the painting by 0.215. This makes sense and is in accordance with what we expected from the graph above. We chose to fit this model because our graph of tree and clouds had an good relationship that we can investigate further.


```{r echo=FALSE}
tidy(glm_cloud)%>%
  mutate(lowerCI = estimate - 2*std.error,
         upperCI = estimate + 2*std.error)%>%
   select(term,upperCI,lowerCI,p.value)
```
![A Painting with a Trees and Clouds](https://i.redd.it/9yp43iybk2zx.jpg)


```{r echo=FALSE}
glm_rock <- glm(tree ~ rocks,
                  data= bob_ross, family=binomial)
tidy(glm_rock)%>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  mutate(exp_est = exp(estimate))
```

On average, the presence of rocks in a painting increases the odds of having a tree in the painting by 0.293. Again, we chose to fit this model because our graph of tree and rocks had an good relationship that we can investigate further.


```{r echo=FALSE}
tidy(glm_rock)%>%
  mutate(lowerCI = estimate - 2*std.error,
         upperCI = estimate + 2*std.error)%>%
  select(term,upperCI,lowerCI,p.value)
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
glm_rock_cloud <- glm(tree ~ rocks+clouds,
                  data= bob_ross, family=binomial)
tidy(glm_rock_cloud)%>% 
  select(term, estimate) %>% 
  mutate(exp_est = exp(estimate))
```

We chose to produce this model because we wanted to see if adding an extra independent variable is going to change the relationship between clouds and tree. By adding the additional independent variable, the odds for the clouds coefficient increase to 0.233, on average. The presence of rocks in a painting increases the odds of a tree being present in the painting by 0.33, on average.  


```{r echo=FALSE}
tidy(glm_rock_cloud)%>%
  mutate(lowerCI = estimate - 2*std.error,
         upperCI = estimate + 2*std.error)%>%
  select(term,upperCI,lowerCI,p.value)
```


### Hypothesis Testing

H0: There is no relationship between tree and flowers (Beta 1 = 0).
Ha: There is a relationship between tree and flowers (Beta 1 does not equal 0)


```{r echo=FALSE}
tidy(glm_flower)%>%
  select(term, p.value)
```

The p value is greater than .05 there we cannot reject the null hypothesis and determine that there is no relationship between flowers and tree.


H0: There is no relationship between tree and clouds (Beta 1 = 0).
Ha: There is a relationship between tree and clouds (Beta 1 does not equal 0)

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(111)
shuffle_cloud <-
  bob_ross %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 403, replace = FALSE, reps = 200) %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  mutate(new_clouds = sample(clouds))%>%
  do(glm(tree ~ new_clouds, data=., family=binomial(link = "logit")) %>% tidy()) %>%
  filter(term == "new_clouds")

shuffle_cloud %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=estimate), bins = 20)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
shuffle_cloud%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  mutate(extreme = estimate > 95) %>% 
  summarize(p_value = 2*mean(extreme))
```

The p-value of 0 means that if the true coefficient of the clouds was 0, the chances we'd see an estimated coefficient of -1.455180	or something more extreme is 0. So it's unlikely to observe something like we observed in our data when the null hypothesis is true. Thus, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis, i.e. there is evidence that there is a relationship between the presence of clouds in the painting and the presence of a tree on the same painting. 


H0: There is no relationship between tree and rocks (Beta 1 = 0).
Ha: There is a relationship between tree and rocks (Beta 1 does not equal 0)

```{r echo=FALSE}
tidy(glm_rock)%>%
  select(term, p.value)
```

The p-value is less the 0.05 therefore we can reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is a relationship between trees, and rocks.


H0: There is no relationship between tree and rocks, accounted for clouds (Beta 1 = 0).
Ha: There is a relationship between tree and rocks, accounted for clouds (Beta 1 does not equal 0)


```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(111)
shuffle_rocks <-
  bob_ross %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 403, replace = FALSE, reps = 200) %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  mutate(new_rocks = sample(rocks))%>%
  do(glm(tree ~ new_rocks + clouds, data=., family=binomial(link = "logit")) %>% tidy()) %>%
  filter(term == "new_rocks")

shuffle_rocks%>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=estimate), bins = 20)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
shuffle_rocks%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  mutate(extreme = estimate > 95) %>% 
  summarize(p_value = 2*mean(extreme))
```

The p-value is less the 0.05 therefore we can reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is a relationship between trees and rocks, while accounting for clouds.

### Summary

Based off of our research, it was found that there are certain objects that influence the likelihood of a tree appearing in Bob Ross's paintings. It is more likely that there will be relationship between tree and the object if the object is in many paintings. It was found that clouds and rocks influence the presence of a tree in a painting compared to having flowers in the painting, which shows there is no relationship. 

Some challenges we faced with our dataset was that some variables only appeared in a small number of his paintings which interfered with the results. Also if there were only a few paintings with both a tree and the specific object we were analyzing, our exponentiated estimate and other statistic were very insigfiicant because some samples were taken without those observations being drawn.
